# Develop Machine Learning Models in any Industry

The below steps give you the brief idea how to develop Machine Learning Models in any Industry like **Banking, Healthcare, E commerce ,Telecom Domains** etc.

1. **Identify the Problem Statement**/UseCases with respect to your Domain and Validate with your Domain Expert in that particular field.

2. **Proceed your ideas/Usecases** to Business Review and explain them in layman terms and get their Approval.

3. Once idea is finalized, Go for **Data Collection for your Use Case/Idea** by having conversion with your BIGData/DataLake Team.

4. **Explore and do Data Analysis** with your Collected Data and try to identify the correct features and remove the unnecessary features according to your problem statement/usecase.

5.  **Do Feature Engineering like Data Quality Check & Data Validation** and Finalize the DataSets

6. **Split your final DataSets** into **Train Dataset (70%) and Test Dataset(30%)**
7. **TrainDataSet (70%) make your selected Machine Learning model** to **understand the Data Pattern** for ***Prediction and Classification*** and give ***good accuracy during TestDataSet*** Execution.
8. Even DataSet can be **cross validated using KFold Validation for Better Accuracy**
9. **Fit your Train and Test Dataset into Python-ScikitLearn Fit Method** to feed your input data into your selected Machine Learning Model and try to understand the Math behind your selected ML Model.
10. Get the **Predicted output using Python-Scikit Learn** Predict Method.
11. **Compare the TestDataSet and Predicted Output for Accuracy-score using Python-ScikitLearn Metrics**.
12. **Repeat the step 9 to 11 with different Machine Learning Models** to find out which model give more Accuracy
